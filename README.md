# Make_Stationary
MATLAB code for deseasonalizing hourly PV/GHI data using a ridge-regularized ELM. It extracts a phase-based seasonal component, computes stationary residuals (PACFsum), and performs a grid search on lag length and hidden units. Includes plots and tools for tuning ELM parameters in solar forecasting.
